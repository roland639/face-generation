# Description

In this project, a DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)
was defined and trained on a dataset of celebrities' faces.
The used 'CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA)' dataset can be found [here.](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)
After the training, new, 'fake' faces were generated, a sample of which is
listed in the jupyter notebook. They look realistic, even hair and women's make up is nicely generated but they are slightly blurry.
